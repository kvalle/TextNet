looking away over the water, was a kind of dull line, that was the

river softened up away off, and warn't black any more, but gray; you
could see little dark spots drifting along ever so far away
(trading scows, and such things; and long black streaks) rafts;
sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking; or jumbled up voices,
it was so still, and sounds come so far; and by and by you could
see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the streak
that there's a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it
and makes that streak look that way; and you see the mist curl
up off of the water, and the east reddens up, and the river, and
you make out a log cabin in the edge of the woods, away on the
bank on t'other side of the river, being a wood yard, likely, and
piled by them cheats so you can throw a dog through it anywheres;
then the nice breeze springs up, and comes fanning you from over
there, so cool and fresh and sweet to smell on account of the woods
and the flowers; but sometimes not that way, because they've left
dead fish laying around, gars and such, and they do get pretty
rank; and next you've got the full day, and everything smiling in
the sun, and the song birds just going it!"""
