"""Classification of feature-vectors using KNN classifier.

The :class:`KNN` class contains the classifier. It can :meth:`~KNN.classify` new datapoints
as soon as it is properly trained using the :meth:`~KNN.train` method.
The :meth:`~KNN.test` method provides a way to classify many vectors at once, and
return the classifiers accuracy compared to a gold standard.
